Welcome to the README, for bands. bands is a program that allows you to keep track of bands and the venues you have seen them at.

It requires a bit of database set up.  Please go into your terminal and input the following commands:

cd ~/{path to the directory}
rake db:create
rake db:migrate

and if you want to test my specs

rake db:test:prepare

It was created with much love by Jim Patt.

Please use responsibly.
